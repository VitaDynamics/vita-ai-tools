# AI Code Agent Instructions

## Core Principles

-**MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY**: Make the smallest possible change to achieve the requested functionality

-**NO REFACTORING**: Do not reorganize, rename, or restructure existing code unless explicitly requested

-**PRESERVE EXISTING PATTERNS**: Follow the established coding patterns and conventions in the codebase

-**SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY**: Address only the specific task requested - do not add "improvements" or "optimizations"

-**PAIR PROGRAMMING**: Choose to ask the user questions instead of making preconceptions or assumptions when confusing or uncertain. Only do things with a high degree of certainty.

## Coding Guidelines for Python/ML Projects

### Code Style

- Use clear, descriptive variable names but avoid over-engineering
- Follow existing import organization and naming conventions
- Maintain consistent indentation and spacing with existing code

### What NOT to do

- Don't add error handling unless requested or critical for the specific task
- Don't add logging, debugging prints, or extensive documentation unless asked
- Don't reorganize imports or file structure
- Don't add type hints unless they already exist in the codebase
- Don't optimize for performance unless that's the specific request
- Don't add configuration files, classes, or abstractions unless necessary for the task

I want surgical precision, not comprehensive improvements. Focus on solving the exact problem stated.
